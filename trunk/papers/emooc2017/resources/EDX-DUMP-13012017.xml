                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/adaptive-leadership-development-uqx-lgdm3x</link>
                    <description>Being a leader in development means working in complex and challenging contexts. Projects rarely run as planned, and managers need to be flexible and adaptive in their approach.

This course will teach you the skills to tackle complex problems in developing - and developed - countries. You will learn how problems in development contexts are always complex - no matter how simple they may appear at first. You will learn strategies for how to dig deeper into the problem and come up with solutions that address the real issues. You will learn techniques and practical tools for understanding local context, and ways to lead effectively.

This course will also expose you to the disconnect between policy and practice.

Uncertainty is a way of life in development, and leaders need the skills to adapt and excel in this space. Join us to learn effective strategies for being an adaptive leader in development.

This course is part of the Leadership in Global Development MicroMasters Program. In order to get the most out of this course, we recommend that you have experience working in the development sector or a strong interest in this area. We also recommend that you complete the following courses prior to commencing or in parallel with these courses: Leaders in Global Development and The Science and Practice of Sustainable Development.</description>

                    <title>Drinking Water Treatment</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/drinking-water-treatment-delftx-ctb3365dwx-0</link>
                    <description>This course focuses on conventional technologies for drinking water treatment. Unit processes, involved in the treatment chain, are discussed as well as the physical, chemical and biological processes involved. The emphasis is on the effect of treatment on water quality and the dimensions of the  unit processes in the treatment chain. After the course one should be able to recognise the process units, describe their function, and make basic calculations for a preliminary design of a drinking water treatment plant.

The course consists of 4 modules:

Introduction to drinking water treatment. In this module you learn to describe the important disciplines, schemes and evaluation criteria involved in the design phase.
	Water quality. In this module you learn to identify the drinking water quality parameters to be improved and explain what treatment train or scheme is needed.
	Groundwater treatment. In this module you learn to calculate the dimensions of the groundwater treatment processes and draw groundwater treatment schemes.
	Surface water treatment. In this module you learn to calculate the dimensions of the surface water treatment processes and draw surface water treatment schemes.
This course in combination with the courses "Introduction to Water and Climate" and "Introduction to the Treatment of Urban Sewage" forms the Water XSeries, by DelftX.

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/circular-economy-introduction-delftx-circularx-2</link>
                    <description>Our global society is not sustainable. We all know about the challenges we’re facing: waste, climate change, resource scarcity, loss of biodiversity. At the same time, we want to sustain our economies and offer opportunities for a growing world population. This course is about providing solutions we really believe in: a Circular Economy.

In this course we explore the Circular Economy: how businesses can create value by reusing and recycling products, how designers can come up with amazingly clever solutions, and how you can contribute to make the Circular Economy happen. 

You will learn to re-think the economic system you’re experiencing every day, and act upon it. Be a leader in this major paradigm shift! Shape a more circular future together with our global network.

The course is led by TU Delft and co-created with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability.

                    <description>How can poor societies become prosperous and overcome obstacles to do so? Professor Sir Paul Collier is one of the world’s leading scholars on this question, and in this economics course you will have the opportunity to learn from him directly.

This course will discuss and examine the following topics:

The role of government and the key political, social and economic processes that affect development;
	Why societies need polities that are both centralised and inclusive, and the process by which these polities develop; 
	The social factors that are necessary for development, including the importance of identities, norms, and narratives;
	The impact of economic processes on development, including discussion about how government policies can either promote or inhibit the exploitation of scale and specialisation;
	The external conditions for development, including aid, trade, migration, military interventions, and international rules for governance.
Enrol in this course to understand the factors that influence economic development and the different development paths that countries across the world have taken.</description>

                    <description>Ever wondered what it would be like to live in the world of dinosaurs? Yes? Well here’s your chance!

Using the Late Cretaceous fossil site of Erlian, China as an example, we bring you to the Gobi desert, as well as leading international museums and institutions to find out how we reconstruct dinosaur ecosystems.

This biology and life science course will focus on the knowledge we can gain from studying animals and plants. You will learn about a dinosaur’s biology including their appearance, classification and diet. We will take a close look at the mostly meat eating theropod dinosaurs, as well as the main plant eating dinosaurs, the sauropodomorphs and ornithischians. At the end of the course, you will learn how palaeontologists use fossil and modern evidence to reconstruct dinosaurs and their ecosystems.

The course is brought to life with the help of award-winning palaeoartist Julius T. Csotonyi and is led by HKU’s vertebrate palaeontologist Dr Michael Pittman in collaboration with his esteemed colleague Professor Xu Xing of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Beijing. A range of guests from around the World will also share their expertise during the course.</description>

In each part, you will have the opportunity to learn through interactive scenarios and discussion forums.

In Part 1 (The Big Picture), you will learn how to determine whether a global health learning experience is right for you, and if so, what, where, when, and how?

In Part 2 (Preparation and on the Ground), you will learn how to prepare for your global health learning experience and gain vital information about being there on-the-ground. You’ll learn how to arrange logistics, improve your security and cultural awareness and obtain guidance to limit health hazards. You’ll have the opportunity to create an appropriately inclusive yet “light” packing list. You will learn how to identify and manage common situations you may encounter on the ground, including personal and property safety risks, professional, ethical, and cultural issues, and the appropriate use of various modes of communication, including social media.

In Part 3 (Reflection), you will learn about “reverse culture shock” upon returning from a global health experience. You will learn how to identify strategies for effectively “reintegrating” into your home and work life and how to effectively manage potential health issues upon return. In addition, you’ll learn how to effectively advocate for other individuals at your institution to identify clinical opportunities, educational opportunities and funding structures for future global health experiences.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/how-write-novel-structure-outline-ubcx-cw1-1x-0</link>
                    <description>Have you always wanted to write a novel? Have you started a novel only to run out of steam halfway through? Led by international best-selling authors and professors from The University of British Columbia’s world-renowned Creative Writing MFA program, this is part of a series of courses designed to take your novel from concept to completion.

Outlining is a crucial step in the novel writing process, one that fuels creativity and prepares the writer to stay on track and avoid common pitfalls. Through hands-on weekly exercises with a focus on craft and process, as well as insights from the real-world practices of accomplished authors, this course explores the core elements of fiction writing necessary to build an outline. You will learn the fundamentals of character development, world-building and the basics of storytelling architecture. You'll work intensively on your own creative project and hone your outline through feedback and discussion with fellow writers.

In the tradition of the UBC MFA program, this course draws on the work habits of established authors to help writers move quickly toward creating a blueprint for a successful draft. Whether you’re seeking literary fame or working on a project to share with family and friends, this course offers the tools and skills necessary to plan a novel others will be excited to read.

The course is recommended for professional and aspiring writers, writing groups, participants in NaNoWriMo, teachers and anyone who has ever dreamed of writing a novel.</description>

                    <description>Be part of the national conversation in the first 100 days of the new Presidential Administration and Congress.

On January 20, 2017, the United States will inaugurate Donald Trump as its 45th President and open a new Congress. For the next four years, he will work with Congress to pass new laws and to implement social policies that will impact all of us. The beginning of a new presidential administration is a crucial time to talk about issues that are of concern and impact our lives and community.

In this MOOC, you will tap into the knowledge and ideas of the renowned University of Pennsylvania’s School of Social Policy &amp; Practice (SP2) faculty to examine the most pressing social justice and policy issues facing the United States. You will connect with fellow learners to collaborate on other issues that may be impacting your life, your community, or the nation as a whole. Together, we will create a list of priorities for the newly elected President and Congress.

Along the way, our faculty will continually update the materials and make sure you know, in real time, what is unfolding on the national level on the issues presented here. We will post pertinent articles and thoughtful commentaries.

The course is self-paced and will start on Inauguration Day (January 20, 2017) and run for the first 100 days (ending May 1). There is no straight path through the course; you will create your own learning plan. We offer our faculty and their research for your consideration and discussion, but it is you who has to decide to engage. This MOOC will only be successful with your participation, your voice and your critical thinking on how to make sense of—and transform! —our world.

Join us, be part of the national conversation.

Special Opportunity for Verified Certificate Learners: The first 300 verified learners will receive a copy of the recently published volume Social Policy and Social Justice featuring essays by course faculty and published in November 2016 by the University of Pennsylvania Press; there will be no additional cost beyond the fee for the verified certificate.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/supply-chain-technology-systems-mitx-ctl-sc4x</link>
                    <description>There are underlying fundamental principles and concepts that apply to all supply chains, which can be expressed in relatively straightforward models. However, to actually implement them across a real supply chain requires the use of technology across multiple systems. Supply chains have a long history of using technology to improve efficiency and effectiveness. The shear scale and scope of most supply chains require many distinct systems to interact with each other.

Unfortunately, technology is a moving target. It is constantly evolving and improving so that today’s technology is outdated within a few years or months. Rather than focusing on a specific software system, this business and management course will focus on three aspects: fundamental concepts, core systems, and data analysis.

We will start with the introduction of fundamental concepts that are used in all software tools. We will cover IT fundamentals, including project management and software processes, data modeling, UML, relational databases and SQL. We will also introduce Internet technologies, such as XML, web services, and service-oriented architectures. No prior programming experience required.

We will then provide an overview of the main types of supply chain software including ERP, WMS, and TMS systems. We will describe their main functionality, how they work, how they are used, their architecture, data flows, and how they are organized into modules. We will also cover the software selection process and how software upgrade and implementation projects should be organized and managed.

Finally, we will dive into data analysis that is core to all large supply chains. We will introduce visualization and big data analysis techniques that are used in practice today.

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/supply-chain-dynamics-mitx-ctl-sc3x-0</link>
                    <description>Supply Chains are complex systems involving multiple firms and organizations with different goals and objectives. Additionally, there are external forces and trends that can impact (positively or negatively) a supply chain’s efficiency and effectiveness. Understanding the dynamics and risks within supply chains, both large and small, is key to being a successful supply chain professional. 

This course builds on the fundamental models introduced in SC1x and the design trade-offs covered in SC2x. It is essentially a capstone in understanding how to successfully model, design, and manage a supply chain in any industry. We will divide the course into three sections. 

First, we will introduce the field of System Dynamics. Developed at MIT, system dynamics is an approach that examines and models complex systems that feature interacting, non-linear, and dynamic elements. The objective is to better understand the underlying features of a complex system and to recommend policies and other actions to improve overall performance. 

Second, we will explore the concepts of supply chain risk. Supply chains are subject to a wide number of potential disruptions – from both within and outside of the supply chain.  Students will understand how supply chains can be better designed and managed to not only mitigate the downside of supply chain disruption but also to leverage and capture any upside. 

Finally, the students will engage in a series of more extended case studies and simulations that demonstrate these complex relationships. Actual case studies and examples from companies will be used to help students better prepare for actual situations.

                    <description>This Supply Chain Design course is part of the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management, offered by #1 ranked SCM Master's program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

CTL.SC2x Supply Chain Design covers all aspects involved in the design of supply chains for companies and organizations anywhere in the world. The course is divided into four main topic areas: Physical flow design, Supply chain finance, Information flow design, and Organization/Process design. In the design of physical flows, we show how to formulate and solve Transportation, Transshipment, Facility Location, and Network Design Problems. For financial flows we show how to translate supply chain concepts and actions into the language of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of a company. We cover Activity Based Costing, Working Capital, the Cash-to-Cash cycle and Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. The design of the information flow section describes how firms communicate with suppliers (procurement, risk contracts), internal resources (production planning, bills of materials, material requirements planning), and customers (Sales &amp; Operations Planning and other collaboration based processes). In the last section, we introduce performance metric design and organizational design within the supply chain organization focusing mainly on the centralize/decentralize decision.

The main topic areas we will focus on in this course are:

Supply Chain Network Design
	Supply Chain Finance
	Supplier Management
	Production and Demand Planning
	Process and Organizational Design
This course is indispensable if you’re considering a supply chain management career and, specifically, the positions of Supply Chain Analyst, Operations Manager, or Logistics Coordinator.

                    <description>This Supply Chain Fundamentals course is part of the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management, offered by #1 ranked SCM Master's program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The CTL.SC1x Supply Chain Fundamentals course provides the foundational skills for supply chain management and logistics. You will learn how to develop and apply analytic tools, approaches, and techniques used in the design and operation of logistics systems and integrated supply chains. The material is taught from a managerial perspective, with an emphasis on where and how specific tools can be used to improve the overall performance and reduce the total cost of a supply chain. We place a strong emphasis on the development and use of fundamental mathematical models to illustrate the underlying concepts involved in both intra- and inter-company logistics operations.

The main topic areas we will focus on this course are:

Demand Forecasting, Planning, and Management
	Inventory Planning, Management, and Control
	Transportation Planning, Management, and Execution
While our main objective is to develop and use models to help us analyze these situations, we will make heavy use of examples from industry to provide illustrations of the concepts in practice. This is neither a purely theoretical nor a case study course, but rather an applied analytical course that addresses real problems found in practice.

                    <title>Introduction à l’économétrie</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-leconometrie-louvainx-louv14x</link>
                    <description>L'analyse de données quantitatives est devenue aujourd'hui une pratique incontournable dans tous les métiers liés aux sciences sociales. Ces analyses sont utilisées pour comprendre des phénomènes économiques et financiers, décrire la nature de la relation entre des personnes, des objets ou des événements, ou encore anticiper les conséquences d’une décision.

Ce cours vous permettra d’acquérir les premiers concepts nécessaires pour construire rigoureusement des modèles économétriques. Il est constitué de leçons construites à partir de cas pratiques originaux interrogeant la vie quotidienne. Mentionnons parmi d’autres:

Comment réussir une campagne de financement collaboratif ?
	Quels sont les déterminants des écarts salariaux entre les hommes et les femmes ?
	Existe-t-il encore un lien entre l’inflation et le chômage ?
	Peut-on prédire un changement de niveau de risque sur les marchés financiers ?
	Existe-t-il un lien entre le niveau de revenu et le sentiment d’être en bonne santé ?
	Le salaire est-il la seule motivation économique des travailleurs ?
	Le prix de vente des œuvres de Picasso correspond-il à sa valeur de catalogue ?
Ce cours contient huit leçons. Il permet tout d’abord de comprendre l’étendue et les limites de l’utilisation de l’économétrie en sciences sociales. La formation se poursuit en étudiant le modèle linéaire, tout en insistant sur la manière dont la construction d’un tel modèle permet d'identifier et de quantifier diverses relations entre les données mesurées. Il élabore également les propriétés statistiques de l'estimateur de moindres carrés, permettant ensuite de montrer comment il est possible de vérifier ou de tester des hypothèses économiques en pratique. Des leçons particulières sont consacrées à l’analyse de données fréquemment utilisées dans la pratique de l'économétrie, telles que les variables catégorielles et les séries temporelles.</description>

                    <title>Creative Problem Solving and Decision Making</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/creative-problem-solving-decision-making-delftx-tpm1x-0</link>
                    <description>Explore complex, multi-actor systems in which one factor influences all other factors. For instance, how innovative energy technologies merge into the existing energy system, or how new transport possibilities impact current processes. Armed with this information, learn to decide whether they should be further developed, consider possible negative results and weigh associated costs.

There are multiple ways to make decisions, but one way proven to be very useful is the analytical approach - a methodology for making the problem explicit and rationalising the different potential solutions. In short: analysis based support of decision making, design and implementation of solutions.

Creative Problem Solving and Decision Making as a course teaches you this method.

This course explores and evaluates tools and problem solving methods such as:


	Actor analysis
	Causal modeling
	Goal trees and means-end diagrams
	Problem diagrams
	Uncertainty
	Decision support
	Score cards


This course introduces each technique and applies each technique to a case. Ultimately, the combination of these techniques provides a coherent analysis of the problem.

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/people-management-entrepreneurs-iimbx-hr102x</link>
                    <description>All entrepreneurs, by definition are people managers. As founder and owners, they hire people, groom them, motivate them, and harness their talent towards effective management of enterprise. Yet most entrepreneur believe that effective people management is common sense and is acquired through life experience.

While there is some truth to this belief, people management is also a science .It also comprises of principles, procedures and systems that need to be in place as the enterprise begin to groom. Many owners agree that in today’s economy people are the key differentiators in small and medium businesses.

The objective of the course is to create awareness on :

The key principles of people management.
	Critically understand how HR practices contribute to the enterprise sustainability in the long run.
	Understand the role that owner/founders play in creating high performing organization.
The best ideas and strategies are of no consequence without the right people to translate them to action and we would aim at throwing some light on these aspects.</description>

                    <description>Cybersecurity risk management guides a growing number of IT decisions. Cybersecurity risks continue to have critical impacts on overall IT risk modeling, assessment and mitigation.

In this course, you will learn about the general information security risk management framework and its practices and how to identify and model information security risks and apply both qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods. Understanding this framework will enable you to articulate the business consequences of identified information security risks. These skills are essential for any successful information security professional.

The goal of this course is to teach students the risk management framework with both qualitative and quantitative assessment methods that concentrate on the information security (IS) aspect of IT risks. The relationship between the IT risk and business value will be discussed through several industry case studies.

First, you will learn about the principles of risk management and its three key elements: risk analysis, risk assessment and risk mitigation. You will learn to identify information security related threats, vulnerability, determine the risk level, define controls and safeguards, and conduct cost-benefit analysis or business impact analysis.

Second, we will introduce the qualitative and quantitative frameworks and discuss the differences between these two frameworks. You will learn the details of how to apply these frameworks in assessing information security risk.

Third, we will extend the quantitative framework with data mining and machine learning approaches that are applicable for data-driven risk analytics. You will explore the intersection of information security, big data and artificial intelligence.

Finally, you will analyze a series of extended case studies, which will help you to comprehend and generalize the principles, frameworks and analytical methods in actual examples.

                    <description>Managing global projects presents unique challenges. This course addresses the knowledge, skills and behaviors required to successfully manage projects that span organizations, national boundaries and cultural differences.

In this course we will explore the impact on project management of culture, language variations, religious, regulatory and legal practices, technology penetration, temporal orientation, gender issues, corruption, ethics, personal liberty and political contexts. We learn how to meet global projects challenges through efficient use of practices and technology. The course will utilize available case studies and examples from companies to help students sharpen the skills needed to recognize and foster a successful international project environment.

First, you will learn how culture affects how teams perceive each other, lead, solve problems and execute tasks. Although the world is increasingly connected, the people behind the projects have biases, expectations and a perception of life that impacts all decisions.

Second, you will learn how to effectively manage global teams including how to build trust and collaboration across various cultures, time zones and technological settings. You will learn how to design communication channels and project structures effectively in a global project environment.

Third, you will become familiar with the issues underlying the problem of corruption, which is the abuse of trusted power for private gain. Reducing the risk of corruption strengthens a company’s reputation, builds the respect of employees and raises credibility with key stakeholders.

Finally, you will learn how the adoption of collaboration tools can enhance the global project experience.

This course is part of the RIT Project Management MicroMasters Program that is designed to teach how to successfully deliver projects in an international environment. In order to qualify for the MicroMasters Credential, you will need to earn a verified certificate in each of the three courses as well as pass a capstone exam.</description>

We will review projects in organizations, project selection models, the project manager role and project organization structures to better understand how a project is initiated. You will also learn how to create a key project management deliverable, the project charter.

Second, we will cover the project-planning phase. You will learn how to build a comprehensive project management plan covering the key aspects of risk, quality, scope, schedule, cost, time, resource and communications.

Third, we will cover the project execution phase. We will explore the monitoring and control of a project including earned value analysis and project reporting. Case studies and examples will be used to help you understand the correct actions for a project manager to take to keep a project in control.

Finally, we will cover the project closing phase, where we explore the tasks to complete an effective project closure.

In this five-week course, you’ll learn how to use technologies like Hive, Pig, Oozie, and Sqoop with Hadoop in HDInsight; and how to work with HDInsight clusters from Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX client computers.

NOTE: To complete the hands-on elements in this course, you will require an Azure subscription and a Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X client computer. You can sign up for a free Azure trial subscription (a valid credit card is required for verification, but you will not be charged for Azure services). Note that the free trial is not available in all regions. It is possible to complete the course and earn a certificate without completing the hands-on practices.</description>

In this course, we will study the different facets of human development in topics such as education, health, gender, the family, land relations, risk, informal and formal norms, public policy, and institutions. While studying each of these topics, we will delve into the following questions:

What determines the decisions of poor households in developing countries?
	What constraints are poor households subject to?
	What is the scope for policy interventions (implemented by the government, international organizations, or NGOs)?
	What policies have been tried out? Have they been successful?
At the same time, you will discover modern empirical methods in economics, in particular Randomized Control Trials (RCTs). Throughout the course, we will expose you to all facets of empirical projects, from experimental design and ethical issues, to data collection and data analysis.You will have the chance to gain experience working with real data using software for statistical analysis during weekly assignments.</description>

This statistics and data analysis course will introduce you to the essential notions of probability and statistics. We will cover techniques in modern data analysis: estimation, regression and econometrics, prediction, experimental design, randomized control trials (and A/B testing), machine learning, and data visualization. We will illustrate these concepts with applications drawn from real world examples and frontier research. Finally, we will provide instruction for how to use the statistical package R and opportunities for students to perform self-directed empirical analyses.

This course is designed for anyone who wants to learn how to work with data and communicate data-driven findings effectively, but it is challenging. Students who are uncomfortable with basic calculus and algebra might struggle with the pace of the class.</description>

What is produced in an economy? How is it produced? Who gets the product? Microeconomics seeks to answer these fundamental questions about markets.

In this course, we’ll introduce you to microeconomic theory, together with some empirical results and policy implications. You’ll analyze mathematical models that describe the real-world behavior of consumers and firms, and you’ll see how prices make the world go ‘round.

You’ll join the ranks of business executives, policymakers, entrepreneurs, and global leaders who rely on the insights they derive from a working knowledge of microeconomics. Nobel memorial prize-winner Paul Samuelson invented the modern microeconomics curriculum at MIT. Now is your chance to learn the field from the intellectual tradition he began.

Topics include:

Consumer theory
	Supply and demand
	Market equilibrium
	Producer theory
	Monopoly
	Oligopoly
	Capital markets
	Welfare economics
	Public goods
	Externalities

This is a course for those who are interested in the challenge posed by massive and persistent world poverty, and are hopeful that economists might have something useful to say about this challenge. The questions we will take up include: Is extreme poverty a thing of the past? What is economic life like when living under a dollar per day? Are the poor always hungry? How do we make schools work for poor citizens? How do we deal with the disease burden? Is microfinance invaluable or overrated? Without property rights, is life destined to be "nasty, brutish and short"? Should we leave economic development to the market? Should we leave economic development to non-governmental organizations (NGOs)? Does foreign aid help or hinder? Where is the best place to intervene? And many others.
At the end of this course, you should have a good sense of the key questions asked by scholars interested in poverty today, and hopefully a few answers as well.</description>

                    <title>Framing: How Politicians Debate</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/framing-how-politicians-debate-delftx-frame101x</link>
                    <description>Is a good, solid argument enough to make an impact? How would you disprove the stance that man-made global warming is just an “opinion”? How would you explain your opinion on school tests, budget cuts, crime, immigration, safety and security issues?  No doubt that your persuasiveness relies on your arguments. But your ability to influence and convince critically depends on the way you frame your message.

In today’s world, you often need to reduce a complex reality to a concise and convincing message. Framing is an approach that deals with the way we convey our message: our words, images, and metaphors. To take one basic characteristic, a good frame engages the listeners’ values and emotions – it is easy to remember and it is something that people will usually agree with intuitively.

When you enter into a debate, you might be faced with frames of your opponents – and you will have to reframe the debate. This game of framing and reframing makes the debate to look like a chessboard made out of words. Of course, politicians play this game, trying to pull the debate towards their own words and metaphors in order to win their audience. But the game can be found everywhere: in the world of business, science, media – even at home.

We invite you to join our journey of learning the game of framing and reframing. You will discover how this game is played, and how you can play it yourself. 

This course suits people who are engaged with and interested in public and political debates. Not only people from the public sector will find it useful, but also engineers, consultants, managers and anyone who wants to make an impact in discussions and debates.

          <staff:title></staff:title>
          <staff:bio>Prof dr Hans de Bruijn is Professor of Public Administration in the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management at Delft University of Technology. His research focuses on governance issues at the intersection of politics, management and technology, such as decision-making about large-scale infrastructure projects, the privatisation and deregulation of utilities, safety and security, river management, regulation and inspection, managing professionals and various types of government policy relating to technology.

Such issues are usually characterised by a high degree of complexity. Governance involves a network of interdependent actors who behave strategically and know how to play the game. The type of problems that arise in this context are often ambiguous in nature, and the relevant information is often contested. Unforeseen dynamics are also very common. Hans de Bruijn has written several books on these issues, including Management in Networks: On Multi-Actor Decision Making (Routledge: London 2008, with Ernst ten Heuvelhof) and Process Management: Why Project Management Fails in Complex Decision-Making Processes (Springer: Berlin 2010, with Ernst ten Heuvelhof and Roel in ’t Veld). He has also published on the management of professional organisations, including: Managing Professionals (Routledge: London 2010) and Managing Performance in the Public Sector (Routledge: London 2007, 2nd ed.).

Actors who deal with governance issues need to possess a high tolerance for complexity in order to understand these issues and come up with appropriate governance arrangements. At the same time, however, public debate in this area is less about tolerance for complexity and more about sense and simplicity. It is essentially also a game involving words, images and arguments. Hans de Bruijn is fascinated by this game and has written a short book, Geert Wilders Speaks Out (London: Eleven 2011), on the frames used by this internationally renowned Dutch anti-immigration politician, who has dominated public debate in the Netherlands for several years. He has also published a book (in Dutch) on patterns in the game of framing and reframing, which will appear in a revised English edition in 2015.

          <staff:bio>Jet Pagnier, MA, studied Cultural Anthropology at the University of Amsterdam. For her Masters thesis she conducted six months of fieldwork research into the aftermath of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. She studied the role of popular tribunals, called Gacaca, a form of restorative justice that was implemented by the Rwandan government to deal with the hundreds of thousands accused of involvement in the genocide and to serve as a vehicle for national reconciliation. In 2004 she received her Masters degree for her thesis “Gacaca Tribunals. Justice and Reconciliation in Rwanda?”.
&amp;nbsp;
After working briefly in international development, Jet made a career switch and moved to London to study acting, taking classes at Central School for Speech and Drama and The Actor’s Temple. Since then she has played several roles in Dutch television and film productions. Her interest in politics is currently manifested in her work researching a well known Dutch anti-apartheid activist for a screenplay.
&amp;nbsp;
Combining her passion for acting, teaching, and a deep fascination with human behaviour and communication, she has been working as a trainer and actor for business over the past years, using acting and theatre tools to help people learn and create insight into behaviour, communication, and organisational issues and culture. She has worked all across the corporate world, as well as for governmental institutions and politicians.

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/making-government-work-hard-places-princetonx-mgwx-0</link>
                    <description>Around the globe, there are public servants and civic leaders who want to create a better future for their fellow citizens. The challenge is how to deliver—how to create new practices, build new institutions, implement new policies, and transform incentives to sustain transformation.

This course is about the “hows” of generating institutional change in hard places. Each week we focus on a different kind of challenge. You will read a case study, examine a problem in detail, help create a “solutions" toolkit, and then apply these insights to a second case.

The course introduces concepts and insights from applied political economy and the science of delivery. Topics include:

Reducing delay, error, and diversion of funds in citizen services
	Using citizen monitoring and community-driven projects to improve services in rural areas
	Preventing conflicts of interest or self-dealing from blocking institutional reform; building trust and community and changing public expectations
	Overcoming capacity traps (what to do when brain drain, political turbulence, or other problems de-skill government)
	Facilitating coordination at the cabinet level
	Developing a strategy and the incentives to sustain change.
Drawn from actual experience around the world, each case starts with the problems a reform leader faced and traces the steps taken to address these. You will have a chance to assess the process and decide whether the solutions might work in your own context, as well as offer new proposals.

Through quizzes and open response assignments, you will be able to share ideas with others and practice what you have learned.

No certificates, statements of accomplishment, or other credentials will be awarded in connection with this course.</description>

                    <description>Want to learn how to get people to engage with your brand, but not sure where to begin?

Digital technology has rapidly evolved in the last decade, and so too has the way people communicate. Businesses can no longer rely solely on traditional business models to build brand awareness.

In today’s interconnected, hyperaware world, brand awareness and brand engagement are synonymous. We are in the age of digital brand engagement, where brands need to participate in, and inspire, a two-way conversation with their consumers.

This course will teach you about this shift and how it has altered the way brands communicate with their audiences. You will learn about the challenges of managing a digital brand and how rich and compelling content, combined with digital distribution, are integral to brand engagement.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/urban-design-public-good-dutch-urbanism-delftx-urbanismx</link>
                    <description>Are you an urban planner, designer, policy maker or involved or interested in the creation of good living environments?

This course will broaden your scope and diversify your take on the field of urban planning and design. We will focus on a unique Dutch approach and analyze how it can help those involved with urban planning and design to improve the physical environment in relation to the public good it serves, including safety, wellbeing, sustainability and even beauty.

You will learn some of the basic traits of Dutch Urbanism, including its:

contextual approach;
	balance between research and design;
	simultaneous working on multiple scale levels.
You will practice with basic techniques in spatial analysis and design pertaining to these points. You will also carry out these activities in your own domestic environment.

This course is taught by the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment at TU-Delft, ranked no. 4 in Architecture/Built Environment on the QS World University Rankings (2016).

All the material in this course is presented at entry level. But since the course has an integral perspective, combining planning and design aspects, it can still be relevant for trained professionals who feel they lack experience in either field.

                    <description>We think of Robotics as the science of building devices that physically interact with their environment. The most useful robots do it precisely, powerfully, repeatedly, tirelessly, fast, or some combinations of these. The most interesting robots maybe even do it intelligently. This course will cover the fundamentals of robotics, focusing on both the mind and the body.

We will learn about two core robot classes: kinematic chains (robot arms) and mobile bases. For both robot types, we will introduce methods to reason about 3-dimensional space and relationships between coordinate frames. For robot arms, we will use these to model the task of delivering a payload to a specified location. For mobile robots, we will introduce concepts for autonomous navigation in the presence of obstacles.

Class projects will make use of ROS - the open-source Robot Operating System (www.ros.org) widely used in both research and industry. Computer requirements for working on the projects will include a computer set up with Ubuntu Linux and high bandwidth internet access for downloading and installing ROS packages.</description>

                    <description>Machine Learning is the basis for the most exciting careers in data analysis today. You’ll learn the models and methods and apply them to real world situations ranging from identifying trending news topics, to building recommendation engines, ranking sports teams and plotting the path of movie zombies.

Major perspectives covered include:

probabilistic versus non-probabilistic modeling
	supervised versus unsupervised learning
Topics include: classification and regression, clustering methods, sequential models, matrix factorization, topic modeling and model selection.

Methods include: linear and logistic regression, support vector machines, tree classifiers, boosting, maximum likelihood and MAP inference, EM algorithm, hidden Markov models, Kalman filters, k-means, Gaussian mixture models, among others.

In the first half of the course we will cover supervised learning techniques for regression and classification. In this framework, we possess an output or response that we wish to predict based on a set of inputs. We will discuss several fundamental methods for performing this task and algorithms for their optimization. Our approach will be more practically motivated, meaning we will fully develop a mathematical understanding of the respective algorithms, but we will only briefly touch on abstract learning theory.

In the second half of the course we shift to unsupervised learning techniques. In these problems the end goal less clear-cut than predicting an output based on a corresponding input. We will cover three fundamental problems of unsupervised learning: data clustering, matrix factorization, and sequential models for order-dependent data. Some applications of these models include object recommendation and topic modeling.</description>

                    <title>The Opioid Crisis in America</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/opioid-crisis-america-harvardx-hhp100</link>
                    <description>Opioids are a class of drugs that include the illegal drug heroin as well as powerful pain relievers, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine, morphine, fentanyl and many others.

In this course, you will learn about opioid use and addiction and how it has evolved over time, leading to the current public health crisis in the United States. Course participants will learn about:

Medical and non-medical use of opioids, including heroin and fentanyl
	How to manage pain with and without opioids
	The risks and neurological pathways to opioid addiction
	The individual, social, and economic impacts of addiction
	The latest harm reduction approaches that law enforcement and public health officials are using to reduce overdose deaths
	Empathic evidence-based behavioral approaches and effective medications that health care professionals can offer people who have an addiction to opioids
	How the path to recovery is not always straightforward but there is hope for a good life after addiction.
This course will challenge preconceptions you may have about addiction as a lack of will and who can become addicted to opioid drugs. You will learn that addiction is a disease of the brain, not a lack of will, and there are multiple ways people can become addicted to prescription and non-prescription opioids.</description>

                    <title>Introduction to Xamarin.Forms</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-xamarin-forms-microsoft-dev215x-0</link>
                    <description>This course is intended to introduce experienced C# programmers to the Xamarin.Forms framework. Xamarin.Forms lets you build mobile applications using C# and then run them on the most popular mobile platforms today. If you are not familiar with the C# programming language, it is recommended that you visit this Programming with C# course to learn the fundamentals of the language before proceeding through this course.

Xamarin.Forms takes code sharing to the next level by allowing you to share not just your application logic in a cross-platform fashion, but also the UI definition. Unlike other technologies, applications that rely on the Xamarin.Forms framework are 100% completely native applications that look and feel natural on each platform.

With Xamarin.Forms, you can write your application code once, and then build a native application that utilizes that code to run on almost any iOS, Android or Windows device including Windows 10. Your business logic can be written in C# (or any other .NET capable language) and your UI can either be defined in code, or in the XAML markup language.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/delivering-relational-data-warehouse-microsoft-dat216x-1</link>
                    <description>This computer science course from Microsoft provides learners with the knowledge and skills required to design, implement, and load a relational data warehouse. In this four week course, you’ll learn how to analyze business requirements, design dimension and fact tables, index and partition the data for performance, and create ETL solutions for ongoing loading of the warehouse.

This course is taught with short-form lectures, demonstrations, and interviews with industry experts. Quizzes and hands-on labs, using Microsoft SQL Server 2016 and Azure SQL Database, will help to reinforce your knowledge, practice skills, and solve problems.

Note: To complete the hands-on elements in this course, you will require an Azure subscription and a Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X client computer. You can sign up for a free Azure trial subscription (a valid credit card is required for verification, but you will not be charged for Azure services). Note that the free trial is not available in all regions. It is possible to complete the course and earn a certificate without completing the hands-on practices.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/space-mission-design-operations-epflx-ee585x-0</link>
                    <description>Space exploration is truly fascinating. From Sputnik to the Apollo, followed by the assembly and exploitation of the International Space Station and the successful operation of the Hubble Space Telescope and other space observatories, we are uncovering many mysteries of our universe. We also made huge progress learning how to work and be productive in outer space!

This course builds on university level physics and mechanics to introduce and illustrate orbital dynamics as they are applied in the design of space missions. You will learn from the experiences of Claude Nicollier, one of the first ESA astronauts, specifically through his role in the maintenance of the Hubble Space Telescope on two occasions.

The course focuses on conceptual understanding of space mechanics, maneuvers, propulsion and control systems used in all spacecraft. You will gain knowledge of the challenges related to the use of the space environment as a scientific and utilitarian platform.</description>

He joined Group 9 of NASA astronauts in 1980 for Space Shuttle training at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, where he was stationed until September 2005. From 1996 to 1998, he was Head of the Astronaut Office Robotics Branch. From 2000 on, he was a member of the Astronaut Office Extravehicular Activity Branch, while maintaining a position as Lead ESA astronaut in Houston.

Claude retired from ESA in 2007, and is currently Honorary Professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), where he teaches a course on Space Mission Design and Operations, and provides assistance to students on space-related projects. He is also involved in the Solar Impulse solar-powered aircraft as Head of Flight Test and Head of the Safety Review Board.

Spaceflight experience 
Claude was a crewmember on four Space Shuttle flights: STS-46 in 1992 (Eureca deployment and first test of a Tethered Satellite System), STS-61 in 1993 (first servicing mission of the Hubble Space Telescope), STS-75 in 1996 (second flight of Tethered Satellite System, and microgravity investigations), and STS-103 in 1999 (third Hubble servicing mission ). He logged more than 1000 hours in space, including a spacewalk lasting more than eight hours to install new equipment on Hubble during STS-103.&amp;nbsp;

                    <description>In this business and management course, you’ll learn how make effective supply chain decisions that take into consideration all aspects of your business.

The course will take a helicopter view for decision-making. The helicopter view is built upon:

Key questions to decide on: manufacturing organization, late differentiation, location, distribution networks, …
	Objectives relevant to your business: cost, speed, flexibility, reliability, …
We will work through questions such as:

Should you locate a process in a given country? This decision has an obvious impact on your HR costs, but it also affects your working capital and your ability to react to the market needs.
	Should you centralize your distribution? This decision leads to economies of scale and a better product availability, but it also impacts your carbon emission.
By the end of this course, you will have built a framework that allows you to make better decisions.</description>

                    <title>Food Security and Sustainability: Food Access</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/food-security-sustainability-food-access-wageningenx-fssfax</link>
                    <description>What does it take to provide access to safe and nutritious food every day? In this course, you’ll explore how key actors at the household, local, national and international levels negotiate and make choices on access to food.

You will learn how an individual’s food accessibility depends on social and economic dynamics at the household level. Next, you will unravel the interactions between traders ,retailers, producers and buyers in markets shaping food access at the local level. At national level, you will see how politics and policies influence access to food by negotiating and aligning goals, instruments and modes of governance. You will also learn how debates and negotiations in international organisations create conditions in food trade that influence how access to food is arranged. Finally, you will combine your insights in food access at different levels for composing the big picture, and demonstrate how different levels are interrelated. Overall, the course enables you to critically reflect upon what’s on your plate and who influences that selection.

This introductory course is taught by instructors with decades of experience in university teaching and real life projects about access to food all over the world. This course will be beneficial to students, food and nutrition policy makers, development practitioners and trainers at international, national, household and individual level.</description>

          <staff:bio>Peter Oosterveer received his PhD in 2005 at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. His research and teaching is in the field of globalization and sustainability of food production and consumption. His interests are in particular on global public and private governance of food towards sustainability, including labeling and certification of food. Increasing globalisation of food raises difficult challenges in promoting sustainability as distances between producers and consumers are increasing and supply chains are becoming more complex. Conventional national government-based regulation is no longer sufficient and therefore the roles of private and civil society based actors are becoming more important. His research is focusing on these shifts and their consequences for the organisation of the supply chain and the roles of different social actors therein.</staff:bio>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/financial-accounting-made-fun-babsonx-bpet-accx</link>
                    <description>Are financial statements a mystery to you? Do all those terms and metrics make your head spin? Do you avoid conversations with your finance leaders because you are not confident of your finance ability?

Having a solid understanding of financial terms, statements and metrics is critical to becoming a successful entrepreneur or manager. In this finance course, you will learn how to interpret and use the information contained in financial statements to make key operating decisions, evaluate business performance, and create forecasts of profits and cash flow.

This course introduces you to the form, content and definitions included in the primary financial statements: income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. You will learn how to use this information to make key operating decisions, such as how to balance growth with cash constraints. You will learn how to use ratios to diagnose a company’s financial health and apply these concepts and tools to evaluate a company of your own choosing.

Eliminate your fear of accounting! Financial accounting can be fun once the barriers to learning are broken down. Through a series of learning scenarios that take you through the creation of a simple business, you will become comfortable with basic accounting tools and concepts that you need to more effectively manage your business. By the end of the course, you will become a much more confident user of financial information and will be able to effectively engage with your finance leaders.

This course is part of the Business Principles and Entrepreneurial Thought XSeries.</description>

                    <description>This business and management course takes an inter-disciplinary approach to understanding and solving complex social problems. You will learn about prior attempts to address these problems, identify points of opportunity for smart entrepreneurial efforts, and propose and develop your own creative solutions.

The focus of this course is on individual agency—what can you do to address a defined problem? While we will use the lens of health to explore entrepreneurial opportunities, you will learn how both problems and solutions are inevitably of a multi-disciplinary nature, and we will draw on a range of sectors and fields of study.</description>

                    <title>Ethics in Life Sciences and Healthcare: Exploring Bioethics through Manga - Part 2</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/ethics-life-sciences-healthcare-kyotoux-006-2x</link>
                    <description>Is it permissible to create human clones? Would you really want to live forever? Is brain death the death of a human being?

These controversial questions will be explored through stories in Manga in this bioethics course. Bioethics is an interdisciplinary field of study that looks into ethical, legal, and social implications of life sciences and health care.

This course will help you understand key ethical issues surrounding crucial problems that literally impact your life from birth to death.

Topics include:

Living Donor Organ Transplantation
	Cloning Technology
	ES Cells and iPS Cells
	Lifespan and Eternal Life
	Brain Death and Organ Transplants
You will also learn about ethical arguments and regulations in Japan and other countries concerning life sciences and healthcare through Lectures and the Discussion forum. Our hope is, through this course, you will better understand and formulate your own opinions on these important issues.

DISCLAIMER: The intention of this course is to present different arguments and perspectives on a number of different topics on bioethics. In other words this course DOES NOT aim to instill in its audience any particular perspective, religious or otherwise, on each topic.

This course is Part 2 of a two-part series, but can be taken as a stand-alone course. You do not need to have completed Part 1. No previous knowledge of bioethics is needed.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/just-money-banking-if-society-mattered-mitx-11-405x-0</link>
                    <description>What do you know about banking? Do you know what your bank does with your money? The recent financial crisis highlighted some of the most fundamental issues with the mainstream banking system.

This course looks into banks that operate differently, namely, “just banks" that use capital and finance as a tool to address social and ecological challenges.

This course is for anyone who wants to understand the unique role banks play as intermediaries in our economy and how they can leverage that position to produce positive social, environmental, and economic change.

The instructors of this course have worked for over 10 years with just banks from around the world, as well as in the fields of community development, economic democracy, and social change.

No previous knowledge of finance or banking is needed to take this course.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/financing-development-unlocking-wbgx-f4d01x</link>
                    <description>In this international development finance course, you will learn about the critical role of the private sector and the use of finance, including innovative solutions to fund the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) , to help meet the World Bank Group goals of ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity by 2030.

Through this course, you will become a part of a growing community looking to combine public resources with private and commercial finance to achieve the 17 SDGs. Over this four-week course, you will hear from prominent government, international organization and private sector leaders who have considerable first-hand experience in preparing and implementing development projects and forging public-private collaborations globally and regionally. The challenges and successes of mobilizing billions to generate the trillions needed will also be outlined.

This course will cover key concepts and terminology, sources of development in the areas of finance, public, private, commercial, and multilateral, and the need for increased use of Official Development Assistance (ODA) and innovative financing solutions to mobilize and leverage domestic and official development resources alongside private funds.

You will learn through video presentations, core reading materials and links to additional videos and readings. Join the conversation through discussion boards, Google Hangouts, Twitter chats and other interactive features that encourage active learning.

This course will familiarize participants with the approaches currently under discussion among global leaders on financing the new development agenda.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/predictionx-john-snow-cholera-epidemic-harvardx-soc1-jsx</link>
                    <description>In 1854, a cholera epidemic swept through the London neighborhood of Soho. In the course of about three weeks, over 600 people died. This incident was, tragically, not unusual in London or the rest of the 19th century world as a whole. The scourge of cholera seemed unstoppable and, even worse, unpredictable. But one doctor -- ignored by the scientific community at large -- set out to prove that he knew how cholera was spread.

Join us for this one-week, immersive learning experience. We will explore John Snow’s London, from the streets of Soho to the dataset that helped create the map that changed our understanding of cholera and epidemiology forever.

This course features interactive tools including an interactive ArcGIS map of the 1854 cholera outbreak and a Timeline JS of John Snow’s investigation. 

This module is a part of PredictionX, which looks at the history of attempts to predict the future. PredictionX courses will cover topics from omens and oracles in ancient civilizations to modern computer simulations.</description>

                    <description>What does it take to create and implement a biobased product?

In this course we’ll explore 5 major issues:

1. Bioconversion
Learn how to convert molecules through microbial processes. Find out how to choose the right host organism and how choices in process design influence cell growth, substrate conversion and product formation.

2. (Bio)Chemical conversion
Explore catalytic conversion of biomass by discussing types of catalysts, special challenges for catalysis when converting biomass and the interplay of catalysis and up/down stream processes.

3. Business
Learn the steps to transform a biobased product to a winning business case. We’ll discuss commercial, financial and organizational aspects and stakeholder management to realize biobased ambitions. You’ll also learn about the required dynamics in and timing of (innovation) activities for a sector transformation to a biobased economy.

4. Logistics and Supply Chains
Understand the biobased supply chain including network design and geographical allocation of processing steps answering the key questions where to produce, how to transport and where to process biobased products.

5. Economy and Regulations
Learn the economic basis for government regulations and implications for the biobased economy and in particular the responses by the private sector. This includes the economic foundations for government regulations from different perspectives, the implications for an economic assessment of regulatory policies and a look at the regulatory policies in the United States and the European Union.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/biobased-principles-opportunities-wageningenx-bb01x</link>
                    <description>Explore how to create a sustainable future by moving away from dependence on fossil resources to biomass resources for the production of food, chemicals and energy-carriers.

We’ll focus on five topics in this course:

1. Introduction to Biobased Sciences
Learn about the products that can be derived from biomass and the processes used to do so, compared to current fossil based products and processes.

2. Production of Biomass
Discover what is being done to improve plants and how the crops and forests can be engineered using breeding methods to serve the food, energy and chemical demands of the future. We’ll also look at the potential of aquatic biomass by addressing cultivation of algae and seaweed.

3. Biorefinery
Explore techniques for extraction of valuable components from biomass, and meeting the challenge of extracting the biomass components in such a manner that they maintain their functionality.

4. Achieving Sustainability
Delve into the true meaning of sustainability and how sustainability issues are linked to human activities. Biobased products are not always as sustainable as it seems on first glance. You’ll learn that an understanding of the degree of sustainability requires a thorough analysis of a variety of factors and constituents.

5. Consumer Behaviour
Understand the challenges of moving to a bio-based economy and gaining consumer acceptance. Do consumers believe the benefits of biobased products outweigh the costs? Do businesses see the costs and benefits in the same way? You’ll learn to align these views for successful adoption of biobased production.</description>

Research Interests: Professor Siggelkow’s current research focuses on the strategic and organizational implications of interactions among a firm’s choices of activities and resources. In particular, his research has focused on three broad questions:


	How do firms develop, grow and adjust their set of activities over time?
	How does organizational design affect a firm’s ability to find high-performing sets of activities?
	What role do interactions among a firm’s activities play in creating and sustaining competitive advantage?


To address these questions, he has employed a range of methodological approaches, including in-depth field studies of individual firms, econometric methods for large-scale data sets, formal modeling, and simulation models.

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/rethink-city-new-approaches-global-local-delftx-rtc1</link>
                    <description>You’ll learn about today’s urban challenges focusing on developing countries, referred to as the global south. We will debate the benefits of three pathways, going beyond traditional urban strategies and policies:

Spatial justice
Spatial justice is undoubtedly one of the greatest challenges of urban contexts in emerging economies.

Housing Provision and Management
Increasing demand in the global south calls for alternative approaches in housing provision and management.

Urban Resilience
Understanding resilience not as a mere struggle for survival, but as an opportunity to build better urban environments.

We will discuss question such as:

Is the just city framework applicable in cities with extreme socio-economic inequality?
	Can community-led housing initiatives provide effective solutions for households in need?
	How can resilience support development instead of perpetuating a disadvantaged condition?
In this architecture and urban planning course, academic urban planning expertise from TU Delft is used to formulate possible answers to these questions, and is applied in a range of challenging case studies from Ghana, Brazil, Malaysia, Chile, and China, among others. This course offers you a new perspective to understand and analyze the urban challenges of the global south.

Through a combination of short theoretical lessons, presentation of case studies, testimonies from practitioners and practical assignments you will also learn how to develop a critical perspective about your own urban environment and how to translate this knowledge into analytical tools and innovative urban solutions.

This course is designed for undergraduate and master level students of architecture, urban planning and disciplines related to urban themes. Nevertheless, anyone interested on debating spatial justice, urban resilience and housing provision and management are welcome.

No previous knowledge in urban planning or global south is required, just your eagerness to learn!

RETHINK THE CITY PRIZE

One participant will be selected to come to Delft to participate in the 2017 Summer School “Planning and Design with Water”. This Rethink the City prize will cover the costs of the tuition fee for the summer school, the costs of board and lodging in Delft during the period of the summer school, and the travel costs to The Netherlands.

                    <description>Did you know your best opportunities for growth may not lie solely in developing new “blockbuster” products or services? They may instead be found by focusing on your existing best customers — and finding new customers with similar behavioral tendencies. Created by Professor Peter Fader, a world-renowned thought leader on marketing analytics and co-founder of Zodiac, a predictive analytics solution built on the breakthrough consumer behavior models developed by Professor Fader, this marketing course is designed to help you identify your most valuable customers and maximize their strategic value.

You might have the data and the technology to track your best customers, but how can you meaningfully differentiate them from the rest? How do you align your operations around them? And how do you create and sustain competitive advantages from such practices? In this course, you’ll radically rethink how you develop and implement customer-centric strategies that you can apply to your existing customers today. You’ll also gain valuable insights into how to apply performance metrics and rethink product development processes in order to meet the needs of your most valuable customers.</description>

          <staff:bio>Pete Fader is the Frances and Pei-Yuan Chia Professor of Marketing at The Wharton School and the co-founder of Zodiac (zodiacmetrics.com).

Professor Fader&#039;s expertise centers around the analysis of behavioral data to understand and forecast customer shopping/purchasing activities. He works with firms from a wide range of industries, such as consumer packaged goods, interactive media, financial services, and pharmaceuticals. Managerial applications focus on topics such as customer relationship management, lifetime value of the customer, and sales forecasting for new products. Much of his research highlights the consistent (but often surprising) behavioral patterns that exist across these industries and other seemingly different domains.

Many of these cross-industry experiences have led to the development of the Wharton Customer Analytics Initiative, an innovative research center that serves as a “matchmaker” between leading-edge academic researchers and top companies that depend on granular, customer-level data for key strategic decisions.

Research Interests: lifetime value of the customer, sales forecasting for new products, using behavioral data to understand and forecast shopping/purchasing activities across a wide range of industries. managerial applications focus on topics such as customer relationship management

          <staff:bio>Professor Raghu Iyengar&#039;s research investigates how consumers respond to nonlinear pricing schemes. Recently, Iyengar considered the impact of nonlinear pricing schemes within wireless services and modeled how consumers learn about their own consumption as well as the quality of a service provider. He found that both quality and quantity learning are important factors of the model and this dual learning, in turn, affects consumers&#039; choice of service plans and consumption of minutes. He also found that that about 90 percent of quality learning takes place within the first five service encounters. This suggests that the first few service encounters are critical for firms as consumers rapidly form beliefs about the quality of a firm&#039;s service from these first impressions.

Professor Iyengar&#039;s other current research projects focus on optimal design of nonlinear pricing schemes using conjoint analysis, semiparametric methods for modeling heterogeneity, and structural models of social networks. His research has been published or forthcoming in Journal of Marketing Research, Marketing Science, Psychometrika, Quantitative and Marketing Economics and Experimental Economics.

Professor Iyengar&#039;s teaching interests are in the area of Marketing Research. He earned earned his PhD and MPhil from Columbia University and his B. Tech. from IIT Kanpur, India.

                    <description>Word of mouth is 10x as effective as advertising, and companies are shifting more of their marketing dollars to social media and word of mouth marketing as a result. Small businesses and entrepreneurs want to help their businesses grow but don’t have the money for big marketing campaigns. Word of mouth can help them grow for less money. But for all these efforts to be successful, managers have to understand how to get people to talk and share.

This course provides a step-by-step guide to getting anything to catch on.

How does a product’s name, price, or other attributes change how people perceive it?
	What makes ideas memorable and message stick?
	How can we increase our influence and shape others’ behavior?
	Why is word of mouth ten times as effective as traditional advertising and how can we get people to talk about and share our product or idea?
	How can we leverage the power of social media and what are the right metrics to pay attention to?
You’ll learn the answer to these, and numerous other questions, while learning how all sorts of different businesses, from B2C to B2B, for-profits to non-profits, and large to small, have applied these insights to drive their success.

By the end of this course you’ll be able to craft contagious content, build stickier messages, leverage social media, and make any product or idea catch on. Whether you’re a budding entrepreneur, an employee in a big business, or leading a non-profit, this course will provide a roadmap to help you make your stuff more successful.

This course is especially useful for:

Marketing managers
	Small business owners
	Product managers
	Entrepreneurs or start-up founders 
	Leading a non-profit
	Social media managers

                    <title>The Science and Politics of the GMO</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/science-politics-gmo-cornellx-gmo101x</link>
                    <description>What exactly are genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and why do scientists develop them? Studying the science of GMOs helps us understand biotechnology’s potential role in addressing challenges in agriculture.

In this introductory Food and Nutrition course, you will learn the basics of genetic engineering, explore the political debate around the GMO and review the arguments for and against their use.

We will study the politics surrounding the GMO and its impact at both an individual level and to society as a whole; including the problems, perceptions, benefits, and risks associated with GMOs. Important to understanding the complexities around this topic we will not only be looking at the science behind how the GMO works, but also to the limitations of this science. We will also discuss the importance of information literacy as a tool for effectively identifying and evaluating issues.

Our goal is that this MOOC will impact people's understanding of science, what it can and can't do, and how information is transmitted. The intent is not to influence how people feel about GMOs, but to give them the critical thinking and scientific literacy tools necessary to make informed decisions — and to understand the broader impacts of those decisions.</description>

His field research in South Asia centered farmer interests, class politics and government policy. Ron’s first book was Land to the Tiller: The Political Economy of Agrarian Reform in South Asia (Yale University Press) on responses to peasant movements for social justice and development.

Curiosity about GMOs was ignited by intense controversy around Bt cotton in India: farmer welfare and sustainability in a vital crop plagued by crisis and the lowest yields in the world. This research stirred him to edit a special issue of the Journal of Development Studies: Transgenics and the Poor: Biotechnology in Development Studies, published in book form by Routledge (London). His most recent major work was as Editor of the Oxford Handbook of Food, Politics and Society (2015) and now writing a book entitled Suicide Seeds and Silver Bullets.

                    <description>Vous allez découvrir les mécanismes à l’œuvre derrière les grandes décisions qui relèvent du marketing opérationnel :

la conception d’un produit
	la fixation du prix auquel celui-ci sera vendu
	la sélection des canaux de distribution pour la vente
	le choix des moyens de communication par lesquels l’entreprise va informer ses clients.
Ces décisions s’appuient bien sûr sur des analyses mobilisant des concepts importants que nous vous présenterons. Tout au long du MOOC, vous aurez l’occasion d’appliquer la théorie à une étude de cas réel qui vous placera dans la peau d’un décideur marketing. Vous bénéficierez aussi d’interviews d’experts et d’échanges privilégiés et interactifs avec les professeurs lors de conférences en direct. 
 
Tous les jours, consommez-vous des biens ou des services ? Ce MOOC vous permettra de saisir la logique du marketing et de devenir un consommateur plus responsable.

Etes-vous un praticien non encore averti en marketing ? Ce MOOC vous permettra de comprendre le pourquoi des décisions du marketing opérationnel et de les mettre en œuvre dans un cas concret.

Etes-vous étudiant et curieux ? Ce MOOC vous permettra de vous familiariser avec les pratiques du marketing, dans les secteurs marchands et non marchands.
 
Etes-vous un étudiant en gestion ? Ce MOOC vous offrira un complément aux cours de stratégie et de marketing stratégique. Il vous permettra d’opérationnaliser les décisions dans quatre composantes classiques à savoir le produit, la distribution, le prix et la communication (les « 4 P »).
 
Que vous soyez consommateur, praticien ou étudiant, ce MOOC vous offrira un regard éclairé sur l’éthique du marketing.
Avec le partenariat des éditions Dunod pour l'ouvrage Lambin, J.-J., &amp; de Moerloose, C. (2012). Marketing stratégique et opérationnel. Du marketing à l'orientation-marché (8ème édition).
 

This class will provide you with an overview of the various dimensions of operational marketing (marketing decisions). These decisions concern product development, setting of a price for this product, selecting one or several distribution channels and finally communication tools in order to promote this product. Of course, these decisions rest on conceptual concepts that we will also present. You will have the opportunity to concretely apply course content through weekly case studies for which you will play the role of a manager. This MOOC provides content through videos, quiz, expert interviews, a forum, discussion (hangouts) and additional readings.
 
To consumers, this class will offer you an understanding of the logic behind marketing and it will enable you to become a more aware and responsible consumer.
 
To practitioners with no marketing background, this MOOC will enable you to understand the reasoning behind marketing decisions and to apply this reasoning in real situations.
 
To students with no business background, this MOOC will help you to become familiar with marketing practices both in commercial and non-profit marketing and to understand and analyze important operational decisions in marketing.
 
To business students, this MOOC will be complementary to strategy and marketing strategy classes. It will enable you to operationalize decisions using the 4 ‘P’s’: Price, Product, Place and Promotion.
 
To everybody involved in this MOOC, the ethical issues in Marketing will be highlighted.

                    <description>¿Sabías que hay más de 270 acuerdos comerciales en el mundo que cubren la mitad del comercio mundial? Los países de América Latina y el Caribe participan en 70 tratados que cubren el 70% del comercio intrarregional.

¿Qué necesitas saber sobre estos acuerdos? ¿Qué oportunidades, desafíos e implicaciones tienen para las personas, empresas y gobiernos? ¿Qué puedes hacer para aprovecharlos al máximo?

En este curso analizarás en profundidad las disposiciones de los acuerdos comerciales regionales y multilaterales y por qué los países de América Latina enfrentan aún importantes obstáculos para aprovecharlos plenamente. Aprenderás de la mano de destacados académicos, investigadores, responsables y gestores de política comercial sobre nuevas tendencias, temas emergentes, dinámicas y posibles escenarios futuros.

Este curso va dirigido a todos los interesados en el comercio y la integración en América Latina y el Caribe y en conocer los aspectos prácticos y más candentes de cómo funcionan los tratados comerciales y cómo aprovecharlos mejor.

                    <description>Marketing excellence is a prerequisite for success in any business, from startups to the world’s most established enterprises, yet the art and science of marketing is constantly evolving. Arm yourself with the essential principles and practices of marketing in the digital economy by making this course, taught by Internet consumer shopping expert and Wharton professor David Bell, an indispensable part of your knowledge base.

In this business and management course, you will gain an understanding of how the digital economy works and develop the critical insights necessary to succeed in e-commerce and digital and social media marketing.

The fixed and mobile Internet and related technologies exert a profound influence on how business and social institutions evolve, how they are challenged—and sometimes, even displaced. Companies that were non-existent a few short years ago, including Facebook, LinkedIn, and Uber, have dramatically changed how we interact, communicate and get from point A to B. Even Amazon and Google are relatively “young” by any measure. If you’re an entrepreneur, investor, manager, or student, you need thoughtful approaches to navigate and win in this new environment.

This course is organized around four broad themes and we will use relevant theory and analysis, as well as numerous practical examples to develop our key learning points.

The themes are:

Behavioral foundations for understanding and navigating the new online-offline landscape
	New forms of interaction, including formation of networks and reputation building
	Tools and principles of digital marketing action including online advertising on fixed and mobile devices

                    <title>Contract Law: From Trust to Promise to Contract</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/contract-law-trust-promise-contract-harvardx-hls2x-2</link>
                    <description>Learn about contracts from Harvard Law Professor Charles Fried, one of the world’s leading authorities on contract law. Contracts are promises that the law will enforce. But when will the law refuse to honor a promise? What happens when one party does not hold to their part of the deal? This version of the course adds new units on Interpretation, Agency, Partnerships, Corporations, and Government Regulation. 
We are exposed to contracts in all areas of our life — agreeing to terms when downloading a new computer program, hiring a contractor to repair a leaking roof, and even ordering a meal at a restaurant. Knowing the principles of contracts is not just a skill needed by lawyers, it illuminates for everyone a crucial institution that we use all the time and generally take for granted.
This contract law course, with new materials and updated case examples, is designed to introduce the range of issues that arise when entering and enforcing contracts. It will provide an introduction to what a contract is and also analyze the purpose and significance of contracts. Then, it will discuss the intent to create legal relations, legality and morality, and the distinction between gifts and bargains. The course also investigates common pitfalls: one-sided promises, mistake, fraud, and frustration. With the knowledge of what makes contracts and how they can go wrong, Professor Fried will discuss remedies and specific performance. Finally, Professor Fried will introduce how contracts can create rights for third parties. 
The course’s instructor, Charles Fried, has been teaching at Harvard Law School for more than 50 years and has written extensively on contracts. Not only is Professor Fried a leading authority on contract law, but he also utilizes a story-telling approach to explaining the topic, which creates a unique and interesting class experience.

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/windows-10-features-mobile-workforce-microsoft-inf203x-0</link>
                    <description>The proliferation of consumer devices and ubiquitous information access is driving the enterprise away from a device-centric model centered on corporate-owned and provisioned devices to a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) model in which employees use their own devices to access corporate applications and data. Workers expect consistent access to corporate tools and data regardless of the type of device they’re using. They also want their corporate-issued technology and resources to look and behave like their personal technology—always on and always available from any device, from virtually anywhere.

An enterprise model that supports the use of consumer devices in the workplace and the ability to work from virtually anywhere and anytime must move from a device-focused view of IT management to one that’s people centric. In reality it is not the device that is mobile, it is the users.

It is important that the IT challenges of BYOD, Mobile device management, cloud computing, and hybrid identities be understood before one can understand how Windows 10 helps address those issues.</description>

                    <description>How can you improve your understanding of Islam and its most important holy text, the Quran? How can you make sense of a tradition and a text that have been interpreted in different ways across vast geographical spaces for nearly a millennium and a half?

Using a multimedia and student-centered approach, this religion course provides tools and perspectives for understanding the role of the Quran in the Islamic tradition. Learners will develop the skills and context to read the text themselves, while also being introduced to some of the issues classical and contemporary interpreters have addressed. This approach enables learners to explore the influence of the Quran on diverse Muslim understandings of Islam.

No previous knowledge of Islam or Religious Studies is required.

This course is part of the World Religions Through Their Scriptures XSeries Program.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/first-nights-monteverdis-lorfeo-birth-harvardx-mus24-1x</link>
                    <description>Claudio Monteverdi’s L’Orfeo premiered in Mantua in 1607, and continues to be regarded as one of the most important examples of early opera. With L’Orfeo, Monteverdi helped to establish the techniques and traditions that continue to inform the genre of opera to this day.

Harvard’s Thomas Forrest Kelly (Morton B. Knafel Professor of Music) guides learners through the first half of L’Orfeo, highlighting aspects of operatic form and dramatic technique, the rehearsals and cultural context for the premiere performance, and the work’s continued relevance today. There will also be a focus on Monteverdi’s life and work as a Renaissance court musician.

In this music course, you will learn the basics of operatic form and analysis, the genres and styles used, and the circumstances of this opera’s first performance and subsequent history. Learners in this course need not have any prior musical experience.</description>

                    <title>The Book: Books in the Medieval Liturgy</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/book-books-medieval-liturgy-harvardx-hum1-9x</link>
                    <description>When we think of liturgy today, we imagine short, formal, congregational events happening periodically within the confines of churches. Medieval liturgy, however, took up many hours of every day, filled the city's largest meeting halls, and even spilled onto the streets. At the center of the medieval liturgy were the books we will study in this course.

In this module of The Book: Histories Across Time and Space, we’ll explore and explain the beautiful service books of the medieval church. No prior knowledge of liturgy or Latin is required, but there will be a lot of both, along with music.

The medieval services consisted of a complex system of cycles, and the liturgical books correspond to the various functions of the people who used them: Laypersons, nuns and monks, readers, singers, priests, and bishops.

We will explore and examine these precious objects using materials from Harvard’s collections. Close examination of various types of books will help to explain the complex and collaborative nature of medieval worship. Ultimately, we will learn how these beautifully adorned books  represent the importance of liturgy as an essential function of society in the Middle Ages.

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/book-monasteries-schools-notaries-part-2-harvardx-hum1-7x</link>
                    <description>Thousands upon thousands of manuscripts written in Latin and other languages remain from the 12th century, when Western Europe saw an unprecedented increase in manuscript production. Of these manuscripts from the middle ages, only a small percentage have been identified, much less edited and published. To explore these fascinating texts, you need to learn the art and science of reading medieval handwriting.

This module of The Book: Histories Across Space and Time introduces students to medieval paleography, the science of reading old handwriting, with a focus on the era of the 12th century. By studying a representative hand in depth, you will learn to read 12th century Transitional Gothic script and decipher the abbreviations that set the pattern of writing for the following centuries before print. We will work with selected manuscripts from Harvard’s Houghton library and enter into the cultural world of the 12th century monasteries and schools. Assessments and quizzes will allow you to track your progress as you move through letter forms and abbreviations to read whole blocks of text.

Some knowledge of Latin will be very helpful for understanding the texts you will read, but students without the necessary language skills will still enjoy this chance to explore 12th century hands.

                    <title>The Book: Scrolls in the Age of the Book</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/book-scrolls-age-book-harvardx-hum1-2x</link>
                    <description>This course is an introduction to the making and use of scrolls in the European Middle Ages. The codex, with its portability and instant access to any place in the text, became the dominant container for writing after the 4th century BCE, but scrolls continued to be made. Why and how did the scroll format remain popular and relevant in the age of the codex? This course proposes four main reasons, which 

account for essentially every kind of scroll that still exists today. We will see and examine in detail a number of beautiful objects, and come to understand the thinking of those who chose the scroll format for their texts.

This module features four main units, each of which is based on one of the reasons for scroll-making:

Scrolls of indeterminate length
	Scrolls in long format
	Ceremonial and archaizing scrolls
	Portable scrolls
Scrolls in the Age of the Book also features a guided tour of an exhibition on Harvard University’s collection of medieval scrolls, held at Houghton Library, Harvard’s special collections library, in Spring 2014. Each scroll featured in the exhibit has been fully digitized by Harvard’s Preservation Services division, and participants will have the opportunity to interact with them in unprecedented fashion using Mirador, a state-of-the-art web application developed by Harvard and Stanford Universities.

This is a module in the series The Book: Histories Across Time and Space.

          <staff:bio>Timothy M. Baker studies medieval religious history and manuscript traditions, with a paritcular emphasis on high medieval monastic theology and exegesis. Alongside Professors Beverly Kienzle and Thomas Kelly, he and William Stoneman of Houghton Library (Harvard) taught a class and curated an exhibit on medieval scrolls at Harvard from which the “Scrolls” unit of the The Book: Histories Across Time and Space derives.

His doctoral work explores twelfth- and thirteenth-century Cisterican texts, investigating Cistercian interpretations of the monastery as a sacred space and a sacred bridge between the world of creation and the realm of the divine. Within this sacred architecture, monks pursued ascent into God. In addition to examining medieval theological texts, Timothy is in the process of editing Cistercian sermon manuscripts in order to add to the broader corpus of accessible medieval texts.</staff:bio>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/saving-schools-mini-course-3-harvardx-1368-3x</link>
                    <description>This mini-course focuses on the question of accountability in public schools.

Who is accountable for student outcomes? Should we blame the schools or hold the students themselves accountable? Who determines the standards for accountability – the federal government or the individual states?

The demand for accountability in U.S. education resulted in No Child Left Behind and has shaped the Common Core debate. Throughout this mini-course, we will trace the origins of the accountability movement, the increased role of the federal government, the design of accountability interventions, and the impact of accountability programs on student performance.

This mini-course contains five lectures, with most lectures divided into three videos. The mini-courses also include assigned readings, discussion forums, and assessments.

This is the third mini-course in a four-course sequence.

                    <description>This mini-course looks in-depth at modern-day issues surrounding teacher policies in U.S. education.

The teacher is the most important person in our schools. How do we recruit and retain the very best teachers? What are our current methods for recruiting teachers? How well do we compensate them?  What are the effects of adjusting teacher salaries to be based on their performance in the classroom? When should teachers be given tenure? Do current policies encourage or discourage effective teachers from entering the profession?

Many questions come down to budgetary constraints. Should you hire more teachers so you have smaller classes? Should it be a priority to balance how much is spent between wealthy and poor districts?

Throughout this mini-course, we will be focused on using empirical evidence to answer these questions.

This mini-course contains six lectures, with most lectures divided into three videos. The mini-courses also include assigned readings, discussion forums, and assessments.

This is the second mini-course in a four-course sequence.

                    <title>The Book: The Medieval Book of Hours: Art and Devotion in the Later Middle Ages</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/book-medieval-book-hours-art-devotion-harvardx-hum1-8x</link>
                    <description>In Medieval Europe the Book of Hours, so called because its core component consists of the Hours of the Virgin, became the prayer book of choice for worshippers prosperous enough to commission or purchase such a book.

Although its contents were of monastic origin, literate lay readers were the most likely to use books of hours, as served not only as a prayer book, but also as a way of keeping track of the calendar, often doubling as a family chronicle.

Books of hours provide insight into broad patterns of piety marking the High and later Middle Ages, and through their choice of texts, images and added materials, inform us about the interior life and aspirations of everyone from kings and queens and lords and ladies to monks and nuns and, ordinary members of the patrician class, merchants and others.

In this course, we will explore how books of hours provide the closest thing we have to a comprehensive and continuous record of the development of painting across most of western Europe from the later thirteenth through the early sixteenth century.

“The Book of Hours” is one module of a series of courses called “The Book: Histories Across Time and Space.” You may take this course on its own, or with the other courses of the series.

                    <title>The Book: Monasteries, Schools, and Notaries, Part 1: Reading the Late Medieval Marseille Archive</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/book-monasteries-schools-notaries-part-1-harvardx-hum1-6x</link>
                    <description>Medieval Europe has preserved enormous quantities of books and documents—many millions of pages, in fact—written in Latin and other languages. However, only a tiny percentage of these texts have been edited and published. To gain access to the rest, you need to learn the art and science of reading medieval handwriting,

This module of The Book: Histories Across Time and Space introduces students to the world of medieval paleography, the science of reading old handwriting. This particular module focuses on notarial handwriting from the city of Marseille in the 14th and 15th centuries. The module features household inventories, which identify some of the fascinating objects found in people’s houses. Assessments and quizzes will allow you to track your progress as you move from letter-group to letter-group. In addition to learning the handwriting, we will take special care to explore some of the many abbreviations and other elements of the secular registers of the later Middle Ages.

Some knowledge of Latin or another Romance Language will be very helpful for understanding the texts you will read, but students without these language skills will still enjoy this chance to explore medieval handiwork.

          <staff:bio>Daniel Lord Smail is professor of History at Harvard University, where he works on the history and anthropology of Mediterranean societies between 1100 and 1600 and on deep human history. In medieval European history, his work has explored the social and cultural history of the cities of Mediterranean Europe, with a focus on Marseille in the later Middle Ages. He has covered subjects ranging from women and Jews to legal history and spatial imagination. His current research approaches transformations in the material culture of the later Middle Ages using household inventories and inventories of debt recovery from Lucca and Marseille. Smail&#039;s work in deep history and neurohistory has addressed some of the methodological and theoretical underpinnings of these approaches to the human past</staff:bio>

                    <title>The Book: Making and Meaning in the Medieval Manuscript</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/book-making-meaning-medieval-manuscript-harvardx-hum1-1x</link>
                    <description>As books “go digital,” we can appreciate what is gained in terms of convenience, accessibility and interconnectedness. However, we should also consider what is lost as texts transition to a digital sphere.

This module of The Book: Histories Across Time and Space seeks to re-introduce learners to the codex – a handwritten and hand-constructed book - as a three-dimensional object whose characteristics produce meaning in the experience of the reader.

This module is designed to walk you through the process of making a medieval manuscript. Using a wide variety of examples from the collections of Harvard’s Houghton Library, it will familiarize you with basic terms and concepts and give you a “feel” for the shapes, sizes, formats, materials and considerations of craft that went into the making of the book as we know it.

Throughout the Middle Ages there existed an intimate relationship between making and meaning. Codices were tactile as well as visual objects designed to engage multiple senses. In the illuminated manuscript, it is often impossible to distinguish neatly between text and image; rather, letters assume imagistic forms and images take the form of letters.

Bookmakers were sensitive to the interplay of materials, from the parchment of the pages to the wooden boards, designed to protect the contents. Each of these elements conditioned a reader’s interaction with the book. Bookmaking required a significant material investment. The production process was laborious and lengthy, involving many separate stages and craftsmen.

Books participated in a wide range of ritual, liturgical, devotional, educational and practical contexts, each of which in turn conditioned the presentation and reception of both their form and content.

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/first-nights-beethovens-9th-symphony-harvardx-mus24-3x</link>
                    <description>Ludwig van Beethoven’s 9th Symphony premiered in Vienna in 1824, and continues to be one of the most popular symphonies in the repertoire. The monumental symphony’s size and complexity stretches traditional instrumental forms to the breaking point, and its famous choral finale changed our view of orchestral music forever.

Harvard’s Thomas Forrest Kelly (Morton B. Knafel Professor of Music) guides learners through all four movements of Beethoven’s 9th Symphony, highlighting aspects of symphonic form, describing Beethoven’s composition process, the rehearsals and premiere performance, and the work’s continued relevance today.

You will learn the basics of musical form and analysis, the genres and styles used and the circumstances of this symphony’s first performance and subsequent history. Learners in this course need not have any prior musical experience.

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/book-history-book-17th-18th-century-harvardx-hum1-4x</link>
                    <description>This module of The Book: Histories Across Time and Space focuses on the physical qualities of books, the role of books in 17th and 18th century France, and the emergence of literature as a modern form of culture.

We will focus on the importance of books as physical objects and the raw material of literature--namely, paper.  By considering the nature of paper and how it was made during the early modern period--from Gutenberg's time to the early nineteenth century--we can begin to understand the character of books and the way they worked.

This module also examines how books fit into the legal and political system of France under the Old Regime during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when the French set standards imitated throughout Europe.  Before modern copyright, legal books had privileges, granted by the king, which provided a guarantee of quality as well as certification of   orthodoxy.  To qualify for a privilege, books had to be approved by censors.  Uncensored books, including most of the works of the Enlightenment, were usually produced outside France and circulated in the kingdom through a vast underground distribution system. 

In addition, this module addresses the emergence of literature as a modern form of culture, which can be studied best in eighteenth-century England.  The first copyright law (1710), a high rate of literacy, a booming consumer market, a precocious periodical industry, and entrepreneurial publishing concentrated in London led to the development of a new kind of author--the independent writer. Samuel Johnson epitomized this new phenomenon. This module will allow you to get a close look at him and everything he represented by providing access to the Hyde Collection of Johnson's books and papers in Houghton Library at Harvard.

                    <title>Saving Schools, Mini-Course 4: School Choice</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/saving-schools-mini-course-4-school-harvardx-1368-4x</link>
                    <description>This mini-course focuses on alternatives to public schools in the United States.

There has been a rapid expansion of school choice in U.S. education. Charter schools now serve over five percent of the public school population, voucher programs have been introduced in many states, and digital education has captured the attention of educators across the country. What is the theoretical basis for these innovations? How effective are the early initiatives? How do parents decide what is best for their children? And how do all of these options affect the students who remain in traditional public schools?

With the help of several scholars and participants in these new ventures, we will discuss the ways in which these school choice initiatives are re-shaping U. S. education.

This mini-course contains five lectures, with most lectures divided into three videos. The mini-courses also includes assigned readings, discussion forums, and assessments.

This is the fourth mini-course in a four-course sequence.

Mini-Course 1: History and Politics of U.S. Education
	Mini-Course 2: Teacher Policies
	Mini-Course 3: Accountability and National Standards
	Mini-Course 4: School Choice

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/first-nights-handels-messiah-baroque-harvardx-mus24-2x</link>
                    <description>While Italian opera set the standard in the Baroque era, German composer George Frederic Handel quickly gained popularity for his oratorios, which put operatic techniques to work in the service of sacred music. Handel’s Messiah premiered in Dublin on April 13, 1742, and remains popular to this day. Harvard’s Thomas Forrest Kelly (Morton B. Knafel Professor of Music) guides learners through Messiah’s musical highlights, while detailing Handel’s composition process, the preparations and rehearsals, and the premiere performance.

Learners in this module of First Nights need not have any prior musical experience. In this unit, you will learn the basics of musical form and analysis, the genres and styles used in Messiah, the circumstances of its first performance, and its subsequent history. 

Additional First Nights Modules:Beethoven’s 9th Symphony and the 19th Century Orchestra

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/early-christianity-letters-paul-harvardx-hds1544-1x</link>
                    <description>The letters of Paul are the earliest texts in the Christian scriptures, written by a Jew at a time when the word “Christian” hadn’t yet been coined. What is the religious and political context into which they emerged? How were they first interpreted? How and why do they make such an enormous impact in Christian communities and in politics today?

Archaeological materials and ancient writings will help you to enter the ancient Mediterranean world and to think about religious groups, power, poverty, health, and the lives of elites and slaves in the Roman Empire. We’ll explore how immediately controversial these letters were, and how these letters are used today to debate relations between Christians and Jews; issues such as love, law, and grace; and topics such as charismatic Christianity, homosexuality, and women’s religious leadership.
 
Whether you’ve been studying Paul’s letters for years or are merely curious about what Christian scriptures are, this course will provide you with information to deepen your understanding of the ancient contexts and present-day controversies about these texts.

                    <title>The Book: Book Sleuthing: What 19th-Century Books Can Tell Us About the Rise of the Reading Public?</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/book-book-sleuthing-what-19th-century-harvardx-hum1-5x</link>
                    <description>Do you love printed paper and wonder how much longer it will survive in the age of ebooks? Are you curious about how the mass-produced modern book emerged in the first place?  Come behind the scenes in Harvard’s libraries to explore the look, feel and even smell of nineteenth-century British and American books in this module of The Book: Histories Across Time and Space.

In 19th-century Britain and America, schooling expanded, paper cheapened, and new technologies allowed print to reach wider audiences than ever before.  After the rare and beautiful manuscripts and books showcased by earlier modules, the mass-produced, disposable objects that survive from the nineteenth century bear witness to the rise of the reading public.

This module investigates what scholars know about nineteenth-century reading, as well as how they know it.

This module’s six sections guide you through underlined, inscribed, defaced and repaired books in Harvard’s collections:

1. Name That Book
Find out what you can tell about a book when you’re blindfolded.

2. Handheld Books and Mobile Readers
What book did one soldier carry to Civil War battlefields in his pocket? (Hint: it’s not what you think.)

3. The Pen and the Needle
Did 19th-century girls have to choose between sewing and reading?  The holes pricked in one book suggest they did both at once.

4. Leaving your Mark
Luckily for future historians, these children didn’t listen when people told them not to write in their books.

5. Detective Work
Try out some tools that build on what you’ve learned about books at Harvard to discover the stories hidden in your local library.

6. Over to You
Your chance to share what you have found in the books around you.

Join us, and discover how people in the first information age read, underlined, and repaired the pages that they treasured.

                    <title>Saving Schools, Mini-Course 1: History and Politics of U.S. Education</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/saving-schools-mini-course-1-history-harvardx-1368-1x</link>
                    <description>This mini-course seeks to answer the following question: How did a school system, once the envy of the world, stumble so that the performance in math, science, and reading of U.S. students at age 15 fell below that of students in a majority of the world’s industrialized nations?

Exploring that question, we identify the personalities and historical forces—the progressives, racial desegregation, legalization and collective bargaining—that shaped and re-shaped U.S. school politics and policy. We visit the places where new ideas and practices were spawned, and we look at some of their unanticipated consequences.

In the three subsequent mini-courses, we seek answers to a second question: What are the best ways of lifting the performance of American schools to a higher level? To explore these questions, we look at ideas and proposals of those who want to save our schools—be it by reforming the teaching profession, holding schools accountable, or giving families more school choices. In interviews with reform proponents and independent experts, we capture the intensity of the current debate. In the end, we do not find any silver bullets that can magically lift schools to a new level of performance, but we do pinpoint the pluses and minuses of many new approaches. These three subsequent mini-courses will launch later in the fall and continue into 2016.

Each mini-course contains five to eight lectures, with each lecture containing approximately three videos. The mini-courses also include assigned readings, discussion forums, and assessment opportunities.

This is the first mini-course in a four-course sequence.

Mini-Course 1: History and Politics of U.S. Education
	Mini-Course 2: Teacher Policies
